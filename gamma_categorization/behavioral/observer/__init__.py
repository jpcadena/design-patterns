# Informed when object's property changes, perform an action, external events
# Listen to events and get notified
# Unsubscribe from events
# Observer: object that wishes to be informed
# Observable: Entity generating the events
# Intrusive approach
# Subscription/unsubscription is handled with addition/removal of items in list
